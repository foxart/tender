Vtiger Integration in dm.comodo.com:
------------------------------------
Ref. Url: https://dm.comodo.com/#sales
- Form validated using jquery [js file path: https://dm.comodo.com/js/script.js]
- After jquery validation, sales.php will be processed by Ajax and response message from ajax will be shown to user.
- Vtiger process is coded at sales.php, which contain the following files:
	class_db.php 	[Path: https://dm.comodo.com/classes/class_db.php]
	class_sql.php 	[Path: https://dm.comodo.com/classes/class_sql.php]
	class_mdm.php 	[Path: https://dm.comodo.com/classes/class_mdm.php]
	functions.php 	[Path: https://dm.comodo.com/functions.php] [But this is old file and functinality not used in current process]
- We can fetch vtiger DB results at https://dm.comodo.com/mdm-db-records.php [csv output]
- mdm-db-records.php file contain the following files:
	class_db.php 	[Path: https://dm.comodo.com/classes/class_db.php]

	class_mdm.php 	[Path: https://dm.comodo.com/classes/class_mdm.php]
About Vtiger:
-------------
- Vtiger is nothing but "saleshub" DB
- We should always use the TABLE "ext_data.web_lead" in vtiger DB
- We should use UNIQUE VALUE for the column "comodo_webform_id" in the table ext_data.web_lead
- Using comodo_webform_id we can identify the form
